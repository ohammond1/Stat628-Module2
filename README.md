# Bodyfat % Modeling
The github is created to have a code, images, and data directories. 

Within the code directory the bodyfat_model.R contains all of the code required to read and process the data, create our model, and create the plots used in the report and presentation. Loading the data in this file requires a working directory to the be parent directory of the code directory.
In the subfolders of the code directory there is an experimental directory containing code created by each member of the group when doing the initial exploratory analysis of the code.
There is also a bodyfat_app directory containing the code and model used to create our shiny app. The shiny app can be found [here](https://chrznc-oliver-hammond.shinyapps.io/bodyfat_app/?_ga=2.65318701.280025751.1665969940-1237250057.1665969940).

The Images directory contains all of the images used in the presentation and executive summary.

The data contains the csv used to create the models and analysis.
